Project Authenticator https://superb-alfajores-2745c6.netlify.app/

üèÅ **Goals**:

In this week's project, we were tasked with building a frontend and backend where we can authenticate users and handle passwords using tokens. We worked on securely storing the passwords in our database, having security and defensive design in mind. We also worked on learning how to build a registration flow and how to build a frontend and a backend at the same time.

The goal for this week was to build authentication for both backend and frontend in a secure and defensive way, protecting and storing sensitive information in a good way.

Overall, we found this project to be very interesting. It was an excellent opportunity to learn more about the importance of security and how to work back and forth between frontend and backend.

We are very pleased with the outcome and looking forward to using the skills and knowledge we gained from this project in future endeavors.

**Must-have requirements**:

‚úÖ The API should have routes to register and login, and finally an authenticated endpoint.

‚úÖ The authenticated endpoint should return a 401 or 403 with an error message if you try to access it without an Authentication access token or with an invalid token.

‚úÖ The frontend should have a registration form which POSTs to the API to create a new user.

‚úÖ The passwords in the database should be encrypted with bcrypt.

‚úÖ The API should validate the user input when creating a new user, and return error messages which could be shown by the frontend.

üöß **The problem**:

We started by going through the design and sketching the different components out along with the design, deciding on how to structure the app. We used a mob-programming approach, starting off by building the entire structure for the backend before moving on to the frontend, and lastly working on the design features.

If we had more time, we would have challenged ourselves by implementing Google authentication with Firebase and added more routes and POST route to create new objects in our database as a logged in user. We would also put more time into the design.
